## 🧭 Profile

I am a **UAV Pilot and Drone Systems Researcher** engaged in **applied R&D at NIELIT Imphal’s Drone Laboratory**, operating within the framework of the **DGCA Drone Rules (2021)** and associated regulatory guidelines.  

My work revolves around the **engineering, calibration, and operational intelligence** of unmanned aerial vehicles — combining mechanical precision with computational logic.  
From flight controller configuration to autonomous mission design, I approach each system as a complete ecosystem of hardware, code, and environmental behavior.

## 🔬 Areas of Work

- **Drone Assembly and Tuning:** Practical experience in UAV assembly, system calibration, and flight optimization for multi-rotor platforms.  
- **Mission Configuration:** Design and validation of autonomous missions using *Mission Planner* for both logistics and reconnaissance applications.  
- **Hardware Integration:** Experience with **Pixhawk**, **Cube Orange**, **Raspberry Pi**, **AI HAT**, **Arduino**, **GPS RTK**, and **LiDAR** modules for precision navigation and situational awareness.  
- **Computer Vision & Autonomy:** Utilization of **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **YOLO** frameworks to enhance onboard decision-making and object detection capabilities.  
- **Maintenance and Reliability Engineering:** Involvement in preventive maintenance, ESC synchronization, and fail-safe mechanism development for mission-critical operations.

## 🧠 Current Research & Development

- **Autonomous Drone Delivery Systems:** Developing a controlled aerial delivery network capable of secure, payload-aware routing for logistics in constrained or inaccessible zones.  
- **Flood Response and Disaster Management UAVs:** Researching coordinated operations between *scout* and *delivery* drones for autonomous disaster response, focused on real-time mapping, payload precision, and data-driven deployment strategies.  
- **AI-Based Flight Intelligence:** Experimenting with vision-assisted navigation models for adaptive flight control and aerial object recognition.

All ongoing work adheres strictly to **DGCA regulatory standards** on UAV operations, safety procedures, and airspace compliance.

## 📡 Professional Outlook

My goal is to bridge **aeronautical engineering principles** with **computational intelligence**, enabling drones to act with greater autonomy, precision, and reliability in critical field operations.  
I see UAVs not merely as devices but as **dynamic systems** capable of assisting in logistics, disaster relief, and environmental monitoring when designed with purpose and restraint.
