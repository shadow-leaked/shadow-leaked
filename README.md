# 👋 Hi, I'm Aribam Aditya Sharma

## 🧠 Who Am I

🎯 A **Cybersecurity Specialist** driven by curiosity and precision — I break systems not for chaos, but to rebuild them stronger, smarter, and more secure.  

🔍 My work thrives where **offensive security**, **embedded systems**, and **Python automation** intersect. From dissecting networks to scripting stealthy exploits, I live in the details that others overlook.

💻 Whether it’s probing deep into Linux internals or engineering real-time solutions, I’m always pushing the edge of system capability and security.

🛠️ Currently engaged in **cutting-edge R&D** at **NIELIT Imphal’s Drone Lab**, focusing on:
- Embedded hardware integration  
- System calibration & validation  
- Secure network bridging for real-time UAV communication
